              The Service enables Clients to run AI-powered email and SMS reactivation campaigns
              targeting their dormant past customers. We generate personalised message sequences
              using AI, manage message delivery, and provide booking infrastructure for appointment

              individuals without such a relationship constitutes a breach of these Terms and may
